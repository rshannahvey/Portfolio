                <img src="images/hello.jpg" alt="" width="15px" height="15px"> Hey there, I'm Hannah. I am a Computer Science Engineering student at SSN College with an unbridled passion for web development and programming. My journey in the vast realm of technology has equipped me with a robust skill set that includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€“ the building blocks of the web.<br><br>
            <img src="images/com.jpg" alt="" width="15px" height="15px"> In addition to my web development expertise, I am well-versed in programming languages such as C, C++, and Java (with a focus on object-oriented programming). My exploration extends into the exciting realms of machine learning and Python, where I continuously strive to unravel the possibilities and intricacies of these dynamic fields.<br><br>
            <img src="images/com.jpg" alt="" width="15px" height="15px"> What fuels my enthusiasm for programming is not just the lines of code but the art of crafting solutions to real-world problems. As a fervent learner and a dedicated developer, I am driven by the desire to create innovative and user-centric applications. Through my academic endeavors and personal projects, I have cultivated a deep understanding of software development, and I am always eager to embrace new challenges and emerging technologies.<br><br>

                <h3>Hate Speech and Offensive Content Indentification in Gujarati and Sinhalese Language</h3>
                I gained a working experience in a Natural Language Processing project on labelling social media posts as hate-speech or not. Here the crux of the problem lies in dealing with posts that are in Sinhalese and Gujarati languages. We used SVM model, and the accuracy level was not up to the mark. Then, we tried to elevate the accuracy by using a DL model called mBERT.

                <h3>Building Websites</h3>
                I have built some websites such as Calculator, To-Do-List, Random password generator and also a E-commerce wesite which soley includes HTML, CSS and Javascript. I always explore to build more because of my passion toward building web applications.
